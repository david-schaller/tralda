## Usage and description

### Tree data structure

The class `Tree` implements the tree data structure which is essential for most of the modules in the package and can be imported from the subpackage `tralda.datastructures`.
It provides methods for tree traversals and manipulation, output in Newick format, as well as the linear-time computation of last common ancestors by Bender & Farach-Colton (class `LCA` which is initialized with an instance of type `Tree`).
`Tree` instances can be serialized in pickle or json format.

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `attributes()` | generator for the node attributes |
| `add_child(child_node)` | add `child_node` as a child |
| `add_child_right_of(child_node, right_of)` | add `child_node` as a child to the right of `right_of` |

| --- | --- |
| `leaves()` | generator for the leaf nodes |

| `get_triples()` | return a list of all triples that are displayed by the tree |
| `delete_and_reconnect(node)` | delete `node` and reconnect its children to its parent |
| `copy()` | construct a copy of the tree (node attributes are only copied as references, but mutable data types should be avoided as node attribute values) |
| `to_newick()` | return a `str` representation of the tree in Newick format |
| `random_tree(N, binary=False)` | return a random tree with `N` leaves that is optionally forced to be binary; new children are stepwise attached to randomly selected nodes until `N` are reached |
| `to_nx()` | return a NetworkX `DiGraph` version of the tree (with the ids of the `TreeNode` instances as nodes) and its `root` (also represented by the id) |
| `parse_nx(G, root)` | convert a tree encoded as a NetworkX `DiGraph` (together with the `root`) back into a `Tree` |
| `serialize(filename, mode=None)` | serialize a tree in JSON or pickle format specified by `mode`; default is `None`, in which case the mode is inferred from the filename ending |
| `load(filename, mode=None)` | load a tree from file in JSON or pickle format specified by `mode`; default is `None`, in which case the mode is inferred from the filename ending |
| `is_binary()` | check if the tree is binary |
| `is_phylogenetic()` | check if the tree is phylogenetic (all inner nodes have at least one child) |
| `equal_topology(other)` | check whether this tree and `other` have the same topology based on the leaves' `label` attributes |
| `is_refinement` | check whether this tree refines `other` based on the leaves' `label` attributes |

    from tralda.datastructures import Tree, LCA

    # construct a random tree with 20 leaves
    tree = Tree.random_tree(20)

    # serialization, reload via Tree.load('path/to/file.json')
    tree.serialize('path/to/file.json')

    # linear-time processing of the tree for constant-time
    # last common ancestor queries
    lca_T = LCA(tree)

    # l.c.a. queries via 'TreeNode' instances or labels (if the nodes
    # in the tree have the label attribute set)
    print( lca_T(4, 7) )

    # triple queries (e.g. is 3 5 | 2 displayed?)
    print( lca_T.displays_triple(3, 5, 2) )

### Supertree computation

The subpackage `tralda.supertree` implements a number of algorithms for the computation of supertrees:
* BUILD (Aho et al. 1981), class `Build` or function `BUILD_supertree`
* BuildST (Deng & Fern√°ndez-Baca 2016), class `BuildST` or function `build_st`
* Loose_Cons_Tree (Jansson et al. 2016), class `LooseConsensusTree` or function `loose_consensus_tree`
* LinCR (Schaller et al. 2021), class `LinCR` or function `linear_common_refinement`

The latter two algorithms compute the loose consensus tree and the common refinement, resp., for a sequence of trees on the same set of leaves in linear time.

### Cographs and cotrees

The subpackage `tralda.cograph` contains an efficient algorithm for cograph recognition and heuristics for cograph editing:
* function `to_cotree` recognizes cographs and returns a `Tree` representation in the positive case (Corneil et al. 1985)
* function `edit_to_cograph` edits an arbitrary graph to a cograph (algorithm from Crespelle 2019) and returns a `Tree` representation

### Other data structures

The following auxiliary data structures can be imported from the subpackage `tralda.datastructures`:
* linked list: class `LinkedList`
* doubly-linked list: class `DoublyLinkedList`
* HDT dynamic graph data structure (Holm, de Lichtenberg & Thorup in 2001): class `HDTGraph`
* AVL trees: classes `TreeSet` and `TreeDict` implement data structures for sorted sets and dictionaries, respectively
