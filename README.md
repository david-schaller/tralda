[![license: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

A Python library for **tr**ee **al**gorithms and **da**ta structures.

## Installation

The package requires Python 3.5 or higher.

#### Easy installation with pip

The `tralda` package is available on PyPI:

    pip install tralda

For details about how to install Python packages see [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/).
    
#### Dependencies

The package has several dependencies (which are installed automatically when using `pip`):
* [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org)

## Usage and description

### Tree data structures

The class `Tree` in the module `datastructures.Tree` implements the basic tree data structures which are essential for most of the modules in the package.
It provides methods for tree traversals and manipulation, output in Newick format, as well as the efficient computation of last common ancestors (class `LCA` which is initialized with an instance of type `Tree`).

The classes `TreeSet` and `TreeDict` implement data structures (AVL trees) for sorted sets and dictionaries, respectively.

### Supertree computation

The subpackage `supertree` implements a number of algorithms for the computation of supertrees:
* BUILD (Aho et al. 1981), class `Build` or function `BUILD_supertree` (import via `supertree`),
* BuildST (Deng & Fern√°ndez-Baca 2016), class `BuildST` or function `Build_st` (import via `supertree`),
* LinCR (Schaller et al. 2021), class `LinCR` or function `linear_common_refinement` (import via `supertree`).

The LinCR algorithm computes a supertree for a sequence of trees on the same set of leaves, i.e., a common refinement.

### Cograph editing

The subpackage `cograph` contains an efficient algorithm for cograph recognition and heuristics for cograph editing.

### Other data structures

* linked list: class `LinkedList` (import via `datastructures`)
* doubly-linked list: class `DoublyLinkedList` (import via `datastructures`)
* HDT dynamic graph data structure (Holm, de Lichtenberg & Thorup in 2001): `HDTGraph` (import via `datastructures`)
